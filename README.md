NB: As of Commit 49 (11 Jan 2014), extensive changes have been made to the SQL database. The default database has been renamed from 'kegerface' to 'raspberrypints'. To this end, the included .sql file has been updated to reflect the new name. You will need to import the new raspberrypints.sql file before the website will function properly again. See Commit #49 commit notes for change details.

NB: As of Commit 47 (11 Jan 2014), you will need to create a new SQL user, usename 'beer', password 'beer'. Please assign this user *only* SELECT privledges and place the user in localhost (not % or ANY).

A Kegerator Interface!
